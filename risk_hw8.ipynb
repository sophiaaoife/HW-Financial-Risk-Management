    "LTCM needed substantial leverage due to the small profit margins on their arbitrage trades. To generate significant returns, LTCM amplified these small profits through borrowing, employing leverage ratios as high as 25:1. This high leverage allowed them to control large positions relative to their capital base, magnifying potential profits. However, it also significantly increased their exposure to risk, making them vulnerable to adverse market movements."

    "    In 1998, the Russian government defaulted on its debt, leading to a global financial crisis. This event caused widespread panic and liquidity crunches in financial markets. Investors fled to safe assets, causing the price discrepancies LTCM bet on to widen instead of converge. This resulted in significant losses. As losses mounted, LTCM faced margin calls and had to liquidate positions in illiquid markets, exacerbating their losses and causing a further downward spiral. The high leverage that fueled their profits now magnified their losses, leading to rapid depletion of their capital."
